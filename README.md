# GAVO DaCHS documentation

This is a first try on pushing DaCHS documentation to a higher level.
As _higher level_ I mean the necessary steps (information and service)
to accomplish the following points:

* improvement/feedback (i.e, contribution) from users/readers
* Features-organized examples (some sort of "gallery")
* provide the information more directly, given DaCHS handles different layers:
  * Data output/retrieved (services)
  * Query/request interfaces (renders)
  * Input data processing (grammars)
  * Resources metadata

I understand working on those topics would make the documentation easier
to understand and be atractive. As a consequence, DaCHS will thrive.

## Steps to take

The above list follows an order. I understand the documentation already 
provided is good enough. Probably, complete (haven't get there already).

The very first step, then, is to provide it (docs) in such a way feedback,
contibution, communication is improved. That is to say, to use common and
interconnected services. The solution that came out was the use of 
`ReadTheDocs + Github`, since the reader can easily jump from the docs
to the repository to an wiki to eventually issues discussion.

The second step would list example of RDs given certain features there 
implemented; be the feature a certain service (ssa,sia,...), a particular
pre-processing applied when ingesting the data or a web renderer widget,
for example. It is more-or-less what the `refelem` page provides, but
grouped by _"features"_ instead of _<elements>_.

The third step would to rearrange (some of) the topics, which often
mix the different _layers_ of the framework.
