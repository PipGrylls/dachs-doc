# GAVO DaCHS documentation

[GAVO DaCHS](http://soft.g-vo.org/dachs) is a Virtual Observatory server suite.
We are maintaining the documentation on github to facilitate user interaction
and contributions.  So â€“ feel free to submit bug reports or pull requests.

DaCHS documentation is maintained in ReStructuredText.  Formatted
versions are [available at
Readthedocs](http://dachs-doc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) --
which is better suited for online use -- and
(including the reference manual and the element reference) [at ARI,
Heidelberg](http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/) -- this lets you download PDFs.

Plans for expansion include:

* Features-organized examples (some sort of "gallery")
* More accessible documentation separated by the different layers DaCHS
  handles, i.e.:
  * Data output/retrieved (services)
  * Query/request interfaces (renderers)
  * Input data processing (grammars)
  * Resources metadata
